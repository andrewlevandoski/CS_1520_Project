# CS_1520_Project
Personal Site for CS 1520

### Part 2 Details
#### Home Page
Coverted home page (index.php) to a static format to act as a better gateway into the site. This involved minimal HTML and styling so that it kept the same content as before, but just looks nicer.

#### Contact Form
My contact form has been modified to actually submit to a database as well as send me an email when filled out. To do this, I included a new file, mail.php, that collects form information and sends an email to me. This obviously required PHP. I also undertook some minor restyling of the form.

#### Dynamic Resizing
Using JavaScript, I implemented a lot of resizing features that make my website scale more nicely on laptops. It still doesn't look great on mobile, but anyone using it on a laptop/desktop/tablet will notice that it resizes elegantly and images/text scale appropriately depending on the size of the screen. 

#### Photos Page
To rid my site of the overhead of a third-party Instagram feed, I instead opted to simply create my own photo gallery (under my "Artwork" tab) that displays my most recent photos. 

#### Conversion to PHP
Finally, the rest of my site has been converted to PHP. While this was easily accomplished my changing my HTML files, some additional PHP has been implemented where appropriate throughout the site. 

### Notes
Materialize framework used exclusively for popup bar (because I like the shadow).

HTML5 UP! Framework used exclusively to get "split" page effect on static home screen.

Hosting through github pages at andrewlevandoski.com (the domain contains all of the content of my site for the project minus the PHP).
